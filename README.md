# JavaScript Snippets Repository

This repository contains pure JavaScript snippets that you can use for various purposes. Whether you're learning JavaScript or looking for code examples, you'll find helpful snippets here.

## Usage

To run the scripts in your Visual Studio Code environment, you'll need to have Node.js installed. Node.js allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser environment.

### Installing Node.js

If you haven't already installed Node.js, you can download it from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/)

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Running the Scripts

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps to run the JavaScript scripts in your Visual Studio Code environment:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the integrated terminal (View â†’ Terminal).
3. Navigate to the directory containing the JavaScript file you want to run.
4. Execute the command `node filename.js`, replacing `filename.js` with the name of the JavaScript file you want to execute.

For example:
```bash
node ./example.js
